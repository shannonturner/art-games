        Written to avoid needing to do multiple try/except blocks when trying to access specific values in JSON.

        Previously:
            try:

            # We could wrap the *whole* thing in a try/except, but then it would trigger the except on the first failure.

        Now:
            title = access(response, ['response', 'docs', 0, 'descriptiveNonRepeating', 'title', 'content'])

            # ... and repeating this structure for each variable we'd like to save.
