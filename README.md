Art Games

Art Mash: Discover art from museums around the world with one simple question: which one do you like better?

---

I originally developed the Art Mash at the Smithsonian American Art Museum Luce Foundation Center Hackathon in November 2013
That code lives here: https://github.com/wesleycho/saam/tree/master/cherrypy

I've since ported it over to django and adapted it to use additional APIs from other museums
